# Snaaake!
## Variation of a snake game by Owen Traynor
- Arrow keys move the snake
- Collect the red pixels to extend the snake
- The snake moves 2% faster with each red pixel collected
- If you run into a wall or into yourself, the game ends
- Sound effects for food collection and snake death
- Looping soundtrack that plays through scene changes

## Broken features
- Pause menu that is supposed to appear with the escape key
    - Provides options to resume game, exit to main menu, or quit the game
- Game over menu that is supposed to appear when snake collides with walls or itself
    -  Provides options to try again, exit to main menu, or quit the game
- Power up has not been implemented
- Buttons react incorrectly to cursor
    - I placed concise gameplay instructions and space bar to trigger gameplay as a temporary measure to show scene change.

All of this will be fixed for my final submission.
